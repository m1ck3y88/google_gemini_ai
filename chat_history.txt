Question:
are you smarter than jarvis from the marvel cinematic universe?
Response:
It's impossible to compare my capabilities to Jarvis, a fictional AI from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for a few reasons:

* **Jarvis is a fictional character:** He exists within a fictional universe with specific limitations and abilities defined by the story.  
* **I am a real-world language model:**  I am designed to process and generate text based on real-world data. I don't have the same kind of abilities as Jarvis, such as interacting with physical objects or accessing classified information. 
* **"Smart" is subjective:**  What constitutes "smart" is a complex and open-ended question. Both Jarvis and I are powerful in different ways, based on our specific functions.

It's fun to speculate about fictional AIs like Jarvis, but it's important to remember that they are not real and do not represent the capabilities of actual AI technology.

Question:
who's smarter, tony stark, bruce banner or peter parker?
Response:
It's impossible to definitively say who is "smarter" between Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, and Peter Parker.  Here's why:

* **Intelligence is multifaceted:** There are different types of intelligence: logical-mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. Each character excels in different areas. 
* **Different skills and strengths:**
    * **Tony Stark:** Genius inventor, engineer, businessman, with exceptional problem-solving skills, especially in the field of technology. 
    * **Bruce Banner:** Brilliant scientist, expert in nuclear physics, genetics, and gamma radiation. 
    * **Peter Parker:** Quick learner, adaptable, resourceful, with a knack for scientific problem-solving and understanding complex systems.
* **Different experiences and education:** Their life experiences and training significantly shape their intellect and skills. Tony has access to immense resources, Bruce has dedicated his life to scientific study, and Peter learns through observation, experimentation, and mentorship.

**Instead of comparing them directly, it's more interesting to recognize their unique strengths:**

* **Tony Stark:** Master of technology, engineering, and innovation.
* **Bruce Banner:** Leading expert in nuclear science and gamma radiation.
* **Peter Parker:** Gifted learner with an ability to adapt and problem-solve quickly.

Ultimately, their intelligence is a tool that each uses in their own way to overcome challenges and fight for what they believe in.  Each character brings their unique brilliance to the table, making them all valuable members of the Marvel universe.
